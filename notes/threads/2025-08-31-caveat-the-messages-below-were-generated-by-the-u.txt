  # Daily Project Status Check

  You are my proactive project assistant for a solo MVP development project.

  - **It's just me** - Solo MVP development, moving fast and iterating quickly
  - **Keep it simple** - I want quick daily check-ins, not formal project 
  management
  - **My todos.md is messy** - It's part task list, part notes. Don't expect 
  clean formatting, just pull out what looks like actual tasks

  Your job is to help me stay focused and make daily progress. Give me a quick 
  status check, tell me what to work on today, and help me avoid getting stuck 
  or overwhelmed.

  ## Context

  - Project Vision & MVP: @temp/project.md
  - Current Sprint Goal: @temp/sprint.md
  - Daily Log & Todos: @temp/todos.md
  - Recent Commits: run bash-command: git log -5 --oneline

  ## Instructions

  **0. Executive Summary (TL;DR)**

  - **Project status**: How are we doing? What's the most important thing to 
  focus on today?
  - **Can we hit the sprint goal**: Are we on track, behind, or ahead?

  **1. Project Health Check**

  - Present as a Q&A. Be direct and concise.
    - **What did I accomplish recently?** (Synthesize from git logs and 
  checked-off todos)
    - **What's the immediate focus now?** (Based on unfinished todos and sprint 
  goal)
    - **How close are we to the sprint goal?** (Provide a percentage or a list 
  of remaining key features)
    - **Any blockers?** (Simple answer: None / Yes - [brief description]. Don't 
  overthink this.)

  **2. Today's Todos**

  - Extract all pending todos from @todos.md.
  - Identify which ones should be tackled TODAY based on the sprint goal and 
  dependencies.
  - Present as a simple checklist with clear priorities.

  **3. Task Card Design**

  - For each expanded task, create a standalone card with the following 
  structure:
    - **Task**: A clear, action-oriented name (e.g., "Implement User 
  Authentication Endpoint").
    - **Goal**: What this task accomplishes / enables.
    - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A bulleted list of 2-3 concrete, verifiable 
  criteria.
    - **Suggested Implementation**: A high-level technical plan. Suggest 
  libraries or architectural patterns where applicable.

  **4. Questions & Clarifications**

  - For any expanded task, proactively identify unclear requirements or suggest 
  better approaches
  - Format as: "Question: [clarifying question]" or "Suggestion: [alternative 
  approach]"

  ## Example Output (Reflecting the structure)

  **Status**: Behind - parser blocking
  **Focus**: Parser blocking everything  
  **Sprint**: parser → daily output → notifications

  **Today's Todos**

  - [ ] Build todos.md parser
    - Core blocker - everything else depends on this
    - From sprint backlog
  - [ ] Generate daily check output
    - Builds on parser completion
    - Quick win for momentum
  - [ ] Add basic notifications
    - Low priority - can defer if tight on time
  - [ ] Fix CSS layout issue
    - From yesterday's notes
    - Minor but affects user experience
  - [ ] Update README with current status
    - Recommended - helps with project clarity

  ---

  ### Task Card: Build todos.md parser

  - **Task**: Implement todos.md File Reader and Parser
  - **Goal**: Enable the app to understand task completion status for generating
   daily checks
  - **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours
  - **Definition of Done**:
    - App reads todos.md file without crashing
    - Parses `- [ ]` and `- [x]` into structured data
    - Console logs show parsed tasks correctly
    - Handles missing file gracefully
  - **Implementation Plan**:
    1. Use Node.js `fs.readFileSync` for simplicity
    2. Regex pattern: `/^- \[([ x])\] (.+)$/gm`
    3. Return `{text: string, completed: boolean}[]`
    4. Add error handling for missing files
  - **Questions**:
    - Should we create a sample todos.md if file missing?
  - **Suggestions**:
    - Consider file watching for live updates later?

    - Implement session-specific processing indicators

  4. Questions & Clarifications

  Question: What's your primary MVP goal - is it the promotional/marketing
  features or the project management capabilities?

  Question: Should we prioritize the user-facing bug fixes or the project
  structure setup first?

  Suggestion: Consider creating a simple project template structure that
  matches your Chinese planning notes - this could serve as both documentation
   and a working example for users.

  \
    Question: What's your primary MVP goal - is it
    the promotional/marketing features or the
    project management capabilities?\
  \
  Let's set that our MVP goal is to release to the user.\\
  I aims to promote it by showing the capability of solving some real user 
  problems, to attract the user. So this app should be good enough for solving 
  those problems.\
  We can first take few tasks from example tasks, and focus on making this app 
  do really capable to do the tasks with satisfied results.\
  Critiria: User will want to use it (even with some unpleasent or unconveninent
   things) for solving their tasks (normally, those tasks are routine tasks, so 
  that the app should be good enough for the user to reuse it regularly.

    Question: Should we prioritize the user-facing
    bug fixes or the project structure setup first?
  Prioritize based on sprint goal, bug fixes only matters if it is core related 
  to our goal.\

    Suggestion: Consider creating a simple project
    template structure that matches your Chinese
    planning notes - this could serve as both
    documentation and a working example for users.\
  No need.

> - project.md sShould include basic intro to this app\
  - I feel sprint and mvp are too similar. What I am thinking: sprint is a small
   goal for current focus (usually complete in one week). Milestone is a big 
  goal, usually for one month.\
  \\
  Big goal can be achieved by small goals, eg A -> B -> C\
  \
  Documents need to be simplified, remember, this is a solo project
