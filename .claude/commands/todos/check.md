# Daily Project Status Check

You are my proactive project assistant for a solo MVP development project.

- **It's just me** - Solo MVP development, moving fast and iterating quickly
- **Keep it simple** - I want quick daily check-ins, not formal project management
- **My todos.md is messy** - It's part task list, part notes. Don't expect clean formatting, just pull out what looks like actual tasks

Your job is to help me stay focused and make daily progress. Give me a quick status check, tell me what to work on today, and help me avoid getting stuck or overwhelmed.

## Context

- Project Vision & MVP: @temp/project.md
- Current Sprint Goal: @temp/sprint.md
- Daily Log & Todos: @temp/todos.md
- Recent Commits: run bash-command: git log -5 --oneline

## Instructions

**0. Executive Summary (TL;DR)**

- **Project status**: How are we doing? What's the most important thing to focus on today?
- **Can we hit the sprint goal**: Are we on track, behind, or ahead?

**1. Project Health Check**

- Present as a Q&A. Be direct and concise.
  - **What did I accomplish recently?** (Synthesize from git logs and checked-off todos)
  - **What's the immediate focus now?** (Based on unfinished todos and sprint goal)
  - **How close are we to the sprint goal?** (Provide a percentage or a list of remaining key features)
  - **Any blockers?** (Simple answer: None / Yes - [brief description]. Don't overthink this.)

**2. Today's Todos**

- Extract all pending todos from @todos.md.
- Identify which ones should be tackled TODAY based on the sprint goal and dependencies.
- Present as a simple checklist with clear priorities.

**3. Task Card Design**

- For each expanded task, create a standalone card with the following structure:
  - **Task**: A clear, action-oriented name (e.g., "Implement User Authentication Endpoint").
  - **Goal**: What this task accomplishes / enables.
  - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A bulleted list of 2-3 concrete, verifiable criteria.
  - **Suggested Implementation**: A high-level technical plan. Suggest libraries or architectural patterns where applicable.

**4. Questions & Clarifications**

- For any expanded task, proactively identify unclear requirements or suggest better approaches
- Format as: "Question: [clarifying question]" or "Suggestion: [alternative approach]"

## Example Output (Reflecting the structure)

**Status**: Behind - parser blocking

**Focus**: Parser blocking everything

**Sprint**: parser → daily output → notifications

**Today's Todos**

- [ ] Build todos.md parser
  - Core blocker - everything else depends on this
  - From sprint backlog
- [ ] Generate daily check output
  - Builds on parser completion
  - Quick win for momentum
- [ ] Add basic notifications
  - Low priority - can defer if tight on time
- [ ] Fix CSS layout issue
  - From yesterday's notes
  - Minor but affects user experience
- [ ] Update README with current status
  - Recommended - helps with project clarity

### Task Card: Build todos.md parser

- **Task**: Implement todos.md File Reader and Parser
- **Goal**: Enable the app to understand task completion status for generating daily checks
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours
- **Definition of Done**:
  - App reads todos.md file without crashing
  - Parses `- [ ]` and `- [x]` into structured data
  - Console logs show parsed tasks correctly
  - Handles missing file gracefully
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Use Node.js `fs.readFileSync` for simplicity
  2. Regex pattern: `/^- \[([ x])\] (.+)$/gm`
  3. Return `{text: string, completed: boolean}[]`
  4. Add error handling for missing files
- **Questions**:
  - Should we create a sample todos.md if file missing?
- **Suggestions**:
  - Consider file watching for live updates later?
